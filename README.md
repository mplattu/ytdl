# Tarmo's Youtube Downloader

This is a frontend for world-famous command-line tools [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and [yle-dl](https://aajanki.github.io/yle-dl/index-en.html). The script uses `at` to create background process which renders the media file according to the given parameters (scaling etc). When downloading from YLE Areena the subtitles are burned in to the MP4 video.

Don't forget to follow the license of the YLE Areena and Youtube video services.

This project is my first React + Onsen UI frontend (see [blog post](http://io.sivuduuni.biz/onsen-ui-react-setup-for-dummies/) of the setup).

The backend is written in PHP.
